This repository illustrates Binder use cases for
`SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_.

.. TOPIC:: What is `Binder <http://mybinder.org>`_?

    Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks? With `Binder
    <http://mybinder.org>`_, you can add a badge that opens those
    notebooks in an executable environment, making your code
    immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

.. TOPIC:: What is `SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_?

    A general purpose, community developed open source software for
    computational mathematics.
